  {
    question: "What is Angor?",
    answer:
      "Angor is fully decentralized, with no middleman involved in the investment process. It has no backend and uses the Bitcoin and Nostr protocols to achieve this.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Angor work?",
    answer:
      "Angor leverages Bitcoin’s scripting language to program spending conditions like timelocks, hashlocks, and multisig. Each project milestone is represented as a UTXO, releasing funds over time using timelocks, while a 2-of-2 multisig allows investors to exit if needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What role does Nostr play?",
    answer:
      "Nostr is used for storing project metadata and facilitating communication between founders and investors. Angor Hub allows you to create custom project views, search for projects, and get updates from founders.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Angor benefit investors?",
    answer:
      "Investor funds are time-locked, preventing rug pulls, and offering more control over unspent funds, which reduces financial risk.",
  },
  {
    question: "What advantages does Angor offer to founders?",
    answer:
      "Founders benefit from a secure platform for investors, unlocking more capital. Investors are guaranteed that their funds are committed to the project, attracting serious backers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Angor suitable for all types of crowdfunding projects?",
    answer:
      "Angor’s decentralized and secure nature makes it suitable for a wide range of crowdfunding projects.",
  },
  {
    question: "What assets can I invest?",
    answer:
      "Angor only supports Bitcoin for investments.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need permission to use Angor?",
    answer:
      "Angor is permissionless and censorship-resistant, just like Bitcoin.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Angor ensure the security of funds?",
    answer:
      "Angor uses Bitcoin’s time-lock contracts and a 2-of-2 multisig approach, ensuring the security of funds at each stage.",
  },
